A data set of acceptance rates for venues relative to Vis and CHI

1. Compilation of this data started from [this list of acceptance rates for graphics, visualization, and vision conferences](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/hive/AcceptanceRates/). 
2. It was then compiled and updated by [Robert Kosara](http://eagereyes.org/acceptance-rates). All data from there was cross-checked with proceedings or the ACM digital library before being included.
3. Steve Haroz then moved Robert's data to a CSV and added a few rows.
